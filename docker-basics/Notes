What is the '--rm' flag doing?
docker run -it --rm ...
docker container run -it --rm ...

By default a container’s file system persists even after the container exits. This makes debugging a lot easier (since you can inspect the final state) and you 
retain all your data by default. But if you are running short-term foreground processes, these container file systems can really pile up. If instead you’d like 
Docker to automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits, you can add the --rm flag
